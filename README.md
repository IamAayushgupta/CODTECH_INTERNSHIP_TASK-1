  -: Project Overview :-
  
The Inventory Management System is a Java-based application designed to help store or warehouse managers efficiently manage their inventory. This system allows users to add, edit, and delete products, 
track inventory levels, generate reports (such as low-stock alerts or sales summaries), and perform various other inventory-related tasks. The application includes user authentication, data validation,
and a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced usability.

 -: Key Features :-
1. User Authentication:

 - Different user roles such as Admin and Employee.
 - Secure login mechanism to ensure only authorized access.
   
2. Product Management:

 - Add new products to the inventory.
 - Edit details of existing products.
 - Delete products from the inventory.
 - Track inventory levels of all products.

3. Reporting and Alerts:

 - Generate low-stock alerts for products running low.
 - Sales summaries and inventory status reports.
 - Export reports to different formats (e.g., CSV).

4. Graphical User Interface (GUI):

 - User-friendly interface built using Java Swing.
 - Easy navigation through different functionalities.
 - Real-time updates on inventory levels and other statistics.

5. Data Persistence:

 - Store inventory data in files or a database for persistence.
 - Load existing data on startup for continuity.

  -: Technologies Used :-

   Java: Core programming language for the application.
   Java Swing: For building the graphical user interface.
   File I/O or JDBC: For data persistence and retrieval.
   Collections Framework: For managing lists of products and users.


  -: Functional Requirements :-

1. User Management:

 - Users can log in using a username and password.
 - Admins can create and manage user accounts.
 
2. Product Operations:

 - Add products: Users can input details such as name, category, quantity, and price.
 - Edit products: Users can update the details of existing products.
 - Delete products: Users can remove products from the system.
 - View products: Users can see a list of all products in the inventory.

3. Inventory Tracking:

 - Real-time updates on product quantities.
 - Low-stock alerts to notify when product quantities fall below a threshold.

4.Reporting:

 - Generate and view reports on inventory status.
 - Generate sales summaries to track sales performance.


  -: Project Structure:-
  
1.Main Application:

 - Entry point of the application with the main method.
 - Initial setup and display of the login screen.

2.User Interface:

 - Login Screen: For user authentication.
 - Admin Panel: For managing users and high-level inventory operations.
 - Employee Panel: For performing day-to-day inventory tasks.
 -Reporting Panel: For generating and viewing reports.

3.Model Classes:

 - User: Represents a system user with attributes like username, password, and role.
 - Product: Represents a product in the inventory with attributes like name, category, quantity, and price.

4.Service Classes:

 - InventoryService: Contains business logic for managing products.
 - UserService: Contains business logic for managing users and authentication.

5.Persistence:

 - Data storage and retrieval mechanisms, either via file I/O or database access using JDBC.
 - Development Process

Requirements Gathering:

 - Define the scope and features of the system.
 - Gather detailed functional and non-functional requirements.

6.System Design:

 - Design the architecture of the application.
 - Create class diagrams, flowcharts, and GUI mockups.
 
7.Implementation:

 - Develop the core functionalities such as user management, product operations, and reporting.
 - Build the GUI using Java Swing.
 - Implement data persistence mechanisms.

8.Testing:

 - Perform unit testing for individual components.
 - Conduct integration testing to ensure all parts work together seamlessly.
 - User acceptance testing to ensure the system meets user expectations.

9.Deployment:

 - Package the application for distribution.
 - Deploy on target environments.

10.Maintenance:

 - Provide ongoing support and updates.
 - Fix any issues and improve features based on user feedback.



By following this structure and utilizing the described technologies and processes, the Inventory Management System will effectively manage inventory operations for a store or warehouse, ensuring efficiency and accuracy in inventory tracking and reporting.
